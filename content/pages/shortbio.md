I'm currently assistant professor at Telecom ParisTech and scientific consultant for the CEA Neurospin brain imaging center. My work is on statistical machine learning, signal and image processing, optimization, scientific computing and software engineering with primary applications in brain functional imaging (MEG, EEG, fMRI). Before joining Telecom ParisTech, I worked at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Harvard in Boston, and for five years at INRIA in the Parietal Project Team and the Athena Project Team. I am also an active member of the Center for Data Science at Universit√© Paris-Saclay.
