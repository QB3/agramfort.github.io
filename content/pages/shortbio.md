I'm currently researcher at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr) in the [Parietal Team](http://parietal.saclay.inria.fr/). My work is on statistical machine learning, signal and image processing, optimization, scientific computing and software engineering with primary applications in brain functional imaging (MEG, EEG, fMRI). Before joining Inria, I was an assistant professor for 5 years at [Telecom ParisTech](http://telecom-paristech.fr) in the [signal processing and machine learning department](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/) and before I was at the [Martinos Center](http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/flashHome.php) for Biomedical Imaging at [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/) in Boston. I am also an active member of the [Center for Data Science](http://www.datascience-paris-saclay.fr/) at [Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).
