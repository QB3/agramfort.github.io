- **Optimization for Data Science** course in [Master program Data Science Ecole Polytechnique](https://datascience-x-master-paris-saclay.fr/): Covers the different algorithms to minimize the cost functions that come up in machine learning (first / second order methods, batch / accelerated / stochastic gradient methods, coordinate descent).
- **Data Camp** course in [Master program Data Science Ecole Polytechnique](https://datascience-x-master-paris-saclay.fr/): Purpose is to build a working predictive model on an applied scientific problem, but also to be able to formulate a data problem as a machine learning task.
