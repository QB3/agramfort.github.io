abstract = "Abstract Despite the common usage of a canonical, data-independent, hemodynamic response function (HRF), it is known that the shape of the \{HRF\} varies across brain regions and subjects. This suggests that a data-driven estimation of this function could lead to more statistical power when modeling \{BOLD\} fMRI data. However, unconstrained estimation of the \{HRF\} can yield highly unstable results when the number of free parameters is large. We develop a method for the joint estimation of activation and \{HRF\} by means of a rank constraint, forcing the estimated \{HRF\} to be equal across events or experimental conditions, yet permitting it to differ across voxels. Model estimation leads to an optimization problem that we propose to solve with an efficient quasi-Newton method, exploiting fast gradient computations. This model, called \{GLM\} with Rank-1 constraint (R1-GLM), can be extended to the setting of \{GLM\} with separate designs which has been shown to improve decoding accuracy in brain activity decoding experiments. We compare 10 different \{HRF\} modeling methods in terms of encoding and decoding scores on two different datasets. Our results show that the R1-GLM model outperforms competing methods in both encoding and decoding settings, positioning it as an attractive method both from the points of view of accuracy and computational efficiency.

abstract = "Abstract Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure non-invasively the weak electromagnetic fields induced by post-synaptic neural currents. The estimation of the spatial covariance of the signals recorded on M/EEG sensors is a building block of modern data analysis pipelines. Such covariance estimates are used in brain–computer interfaces (BCI) systems, in nearly all source localization methods for spatial whitening as well as for data covariance estimation in beamformers. The rationale for such models is that the signals can be modeled by a zero mean Gaussian distribution. While maximizing the Gaussian likelihood seems natural, it leads to a covariance estimate known as empirical covariance (EC). It turns out that the \{EC\} is a poor estimate of the true covariance when the number of samples is small. To address this issue the estimation needs to be regularized. The most common approach downweights off-diagonal coefficients, while more advanced regularization methods are based on shrinkage techniques or generative models with low rank assumptions: probabilistic \{PCA\} (PPCA) and factor analysis (FA). Using cross-validation all of these models can be tuned and compared based on Gaussian likelihood computed on unseen data. We investigated these models on simulations, one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as well as magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets from the most common \{MEG\} systems. First, our results demonstrate that different models can be the best, depending on the number of samples, heterogeneity of sensor types and noise properties. Second, we show that the models tuned by cross-validation are superior to models with hand-selected regularization. Hence, we propose an automated solution to the often overlooked problem of covariance estimation of M/EEG signals. The relevance of the procedure is demonstrated here for spatial whitening and source localization of \{MEG\} signals. "

    abstract = {{MEG/EEG source imaging allows for the non-invasive analysis of brain activity with high temporal and good spatial resolution. As the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem is ill-posed, a priori information is required to find a unique source estimate. For the analysis of evoked brain activity, spatial sparsity of the neuronal activation can be assumed. Due to the convexity, l1-norm based constraints are often used for this, which however lead to source estimates biased in amplitude and often suboptimal in terms of source selection. As an alternative, non-convex regularization functionals such as lp-quasinorms with 0 < p < 1 can be used. In this work, we present a MEG/EEG inverse solver based on a l2,0.5-quasinorm penalty promoting spatial sparsity as well as temporal stationarity of the brain activity. For solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose the iterative reweighted Mixed Norm Estimate, which is based on reweighted convex optimization and combines a block coordinate descent scheme and an active set strategy to solve each surrogate problem efficiently. We provide empirical evidence based on simulations and analysis of MEG data that the proposed method outperforms the standard Mixed Norm Estimate in terms of active source identification and amplitude bias}},

This technique offers a very high temporal resolution that allows noninvasive brain exploration at a millisecond (ms) time scale. Decoding, a.k.a. brain reading, consists in predicting from neuroimaging data the subject's behavior and/or the parameters of the perceived stimuli. This is facilitated by the use of supervised learning techniques. In this work we consider the problem of decoding a target variable with ordered values. This target reflects the use of a parametric experimental design in which a parameter of the stimulus is continuously modulated during the experiment. The decoding step is performed by a Ridge regression. The evaluation metric, given the ordinal nature of the target is performed by a ranking metric. On a visual paradigm consisting of random dot kinematograms with 7 coherence levels recorded on 36 subjects we show that one can predict the perceptual thresholds of the subjects from the MEG data.

However, the corresponding optimization problem is very challenging: it is non-smooth, non-separable and heavily ill-conditioned. For the penalty to fully exercise its structuring effect on the maps, this optimization problem must be solved to a good tolerance resulting in a computational challenge. Here we explore a wide variety of solvers and exhibit their convergence properties on fMRI data. We introduce a variant of smooth solvers and show that it is a promising approach in these settings.

abstract ={In recent years, numerous electrophysiological signatures of consciousness have been proposed. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of these electroencephalography markers by quantifying their efficiency in differentiating patients in a vegetative state from those in a minimally conscious or conscious state. Capitalizing on a review of previous experiments and current theories, we identify a series of measures that can be organized into four dimensions: (i) event-related potentials versus ongoing electroencephalography activity; (ii) local dynamics versus inter-electrode information exchange; (iii) spectral patterns versus information complexity; and (iv) average versus fluctuations over the recording session. We analysed a large set of 181 high-density electroencephalography recordings acquired in a 30 minutes protocol. We show that low-frequency power, electroencephalography complexity, and information exchange constitute the most reliable signatures of the conscious state. When combined, these measures synergize to allow an automatic classification of patients’ state of consciousness.},

ABSTRACT={Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging data analysis.Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g. multivariate analysisof activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used indecoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations,while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g. resting statefunctional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functionalneuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, canbe used to perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very large set of statisticallearning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and its application to neuroimaging dataprovides a versatile tool to study the brain.}}

    abstract = {<p>The brain response to auditory novelty comprises two main EEG components: an early mismatch negativity and a late P300. Whereas the former has been proposed to reflect a prediction error, the latter is often associated with working memory updating. Interestingly, these two proposals predict fundamentally different dynamics: prediction errors are thought to propagate serially through several distinct brain areas, while working memory supposes that activity is sustained over time within a stable set of brain areas. Here we test this temporal dissociation by showing how the generalization of brain activity patterns across time can characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural processes. This method is applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings acquired from healthy participants who were presented with two types of auditory novelty. Following our predictions, the results show that the mismatch evoked by a local novelty leads to the sequential recruitment of distinct and short-lived patterns of brain activity. In sharp contrast, the global novelty evoked by an unexpected sequence of five sounds elicits a sustained state of brain activity that lasts for several hundreds of milliseconds. The present results highlight how MEG combined with multivariate pattern analyses can characterize the dynamics of human cortical processes.</p>},

ABSTRACT={Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is achallenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE softwaresuite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions.All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts.Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (Numpy, Scipy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices.MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.}}

Here, we consider decoding as a statistical estimation problem and show that injecting a spatial segmentation prior leads to unmatched performance in recovering predictive regions. Specifically, we use L1 penalization to set voxels to zero and Total-Variation (TV) penalization to segment regions. Our contribution is two-fold. On the one hand, we show via extensive experiments that, amongst a large selection of decoding and brain-mapping strategies, TV+L1 leads to best region recovery. On the other hand, we consider implementation issues related to this estimator. To tackle efficiently this joint prediction-segmentation problem we introduce a fast optimization algorithm based on a primal-dual approach. We also tackle automatic setting of hyper-parameters and fast computation of image operation on the irregular masks that arise in brain imaging.}},

As a drawback, the dictionary only encodes basic structures. In addition, this approach treats patches of different locations in one single set, which means a loss of information when features are well-aligned across signals. This is the case, for instance, in multi-trial magneto- or electroencephalography (M/EEG). Learning the dictionary on the entire signals could make use of the alignement and reveal higher-level features. In this case, however, small missalignements or phase variations of features would not be compensated for. In this paper, we propose an extension to the common dictionary learning framework to overcome these limitations by allowing atoms to adapt their position across signals. The method is validated on simulated and real neuroelectric data.}},

    abstract = {{Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the electromagnetic signals produced by brain activity. In order to address the issue of limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with raw data, acquisitions consist of multiple repetitions of the same experiment. An important challenge arising from such data is the variability of brain activations over the repetitions. It hinders statistical analysis such as prediction performance in a supervised learning setup. One such confounding variability is the time offset of the peak of the activation, which varies across repetitions. We propose to address this misalignment issue by explicitly modeling time shifts of different brain responses in a classification setup. To this end, we use the latent support vector machine (LSVM) formulation, where the latent shifts are inferred while learning the classifier parameters. The inferred shifts are further used to improve the SNR of the M/EEG data, and to infer the chronometry and the sequence of activations across the brain regions that are involved in the experimental task. Results are validated on a long term memory retrieval task, showing significant improvement using the proposed latent discriminative method.}},

abstract ={Long-range cortical functional connectivity is often reduced in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the nature of local cortical functional connectivity in ASD has remained elusive. We used magnetoencephalography to measure task-related local functional connectivity, as manifested by coupling between the phase of alpha oscillations and the amplitude of gamma oscillations, in the fusiform face area (FFA) of individuals diagnosed with ASD and typically developing individuals while they viewed neutral faces, emotional faces, and houses. We also measured task-related long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and the rest of the cortex during the same paradigm. In agreement with earlier studies, long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and three distant cortical regions was reduced in the ASD group. However, contrary to the prevailing hypothesis in the field, we found that local functional connectivity within the FFA was also reduced in individuals with ASD when viewing faces. Furthermore, the strength of long-range functional connectivity was directly correlated to the strength of local functional connectivity in both groups; thus, long-range and local connectivity were reduced proportionally in the ASD group. Finally, the magnitude of local functional connectivity correlated with ASD severity, and statistical classification using local and long-range functional connectivity data identified ASD diagnosis with 90% accuracy. These results suggest that failure to entrain neuronal assemblies fully both within and across cortical regions may be characteristic of ASD.},

Given this estimated model of the signal, we can extract better estimates of the signal from noisy measurements and also speed up acquisition by reducing the number of acquired DWI while giving access to high resolution DSI data. The method learns jointly for all the acquired DWI and scales to full brain data. Working with two sets of 515 DWI images acquired on two different subjects we show that using just half of the data (258 DWI) we can better predict the other 257 DWI than the classic symmetry procedure. The observation holds even if the diffusion profiles are estimated on a different subject dataset from an undersampled q-space of 40 measurements.}},

In particular, they highlight distributed set of mutually correlated regions that correspond to brain networks related to different cognitive functions. Yet graph-theoretical studies of neural connections give a different picture: that of a highly integrated system with small-world properties: local clustering but with short pathways across the complete structure. We examine the conditional independence properties of the fMRI signal, i.e. its Markov structure, to find realistic assumptions on the connectivity structure that are required to explain the observed functional connectivity. In particular we seek a decomposition of the Markov structure into segregated functional networks using decomposable graphs: a set of strongly-connected and partially overlapping cliques. We introduce a new method to efficiently extract such cliques on a large, strongly-connected graph. We compare methods learning different graph structures from functional connectivity by testing the goodness of fit of the model they learn on new data. We find that summarizing the structure as strongly-connected networks can give a good description only for very large and overlapping networks. These results highlight that Markov models are good tools to identify the structure of brain connectivity from fMRI signals, but for this purpose they must reflect the small-world properties of the underlying neural systems.}},

This problem can be cast into a linear supervised learning task where the neuroimaging data are used as predictors for the stimulus. Brain mapping is then seen as a support recovery problem. On functional MRI (fMRI) data, this problem is particularly challenging as i) the number of samples is small due to lim- ited acquisition time and ii) the variables are strongly correlated. We propose to overcome these difficulties using sparse regression models over new variables obtained by clustering of the original variables. The use of randomization techniques, e.g. bootstrap samples, and clustering of the variables improves the recovery properties of sparse methods.

We build a decoder that predicts the visual percept formed by four letter words, allowing us to identify words that were not present in the training data. To do so, we cast the learning problem as multiple classification problems after describing words with multiple binary attributes. This work goes beyond the identification or reconstruction of single letters or simple geometrical shapes and addresses a challenging estimation problem, that is the prediction of multiple variables from a single observation, hence facing the problem of learning multiple predictors from correlated inputs.}},

Up to now, much effort has been made to improve decoding by incorporating prior knowledge in the form of a particular regularization term. In this paper we demonstrate that further improvement can be made by accounting for non-linearities using a ranking approach rather than the commonly used least-square regression. Through simulation, we compare the recovery properties of our approach to linear models commonly used in fMRI based decoding. We demonstrate the superiority of ranking with a real fMRI dataset.},

A standard linear regression does model such information, however the linearity assumption is likely not be satisfied when predicting from pixel intensities in an image.

    abstract = {{Inverse inference, or "brain reading", is a recent paradigm for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, based on pattern recognition and statistical learning. By predicting some cognitive variables related to brain activation maps, this approach aims at decoding brain activity. Inverse inference takes into account the multivariate information between voxels and is currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitive information is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However, it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since there are far more features than samples, i.e., more voxels than fMRI volumes. To address this problem, different methods have been proposed, such as, among others, univariate feature selection, feature agglomeration and regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider a sparse hierarchical structured regularization. Specifically, the penalization we use is constructed from a tree that is obtained by spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering. This approach encodes the spatial structure of the data at different scales into the regularization, which makes the overall prediction procedure more robust to inter-subject variability. The regularization used induces the selection of spatially coherent predictive brain regions simultaneously at different scales. We test our algorithm on real data acquired to study the mental representation of objects, and we show that the proposed algorithm not only delineates meaningful brain regions but yields as well better prediction accuracy than reference methods.}},

    abstract = {{Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the electromagnetic fields produced by the neural electrical currents. Given a conductor model for the head, and the distribution of source currents in the brain, Maxwell's equations allow one to compute the ensuing M/EEG signals. Given the actual M/EEG measurements and the solution of this forward problem, one can localize, in space and in time, the brain regions that have produced the recorded data. However, due to the physics of the problem, the limited number of sensors compared to the number of possible source locations, and measurement noise, this inverse problem is ill-posed. Consequently, additional constraints are needed. Classical inverse solvers, often called minimum norm estimates (MNE), promote source estimates with a small ℓ(2) norm. Here, we consider a more general class of priors based on mixed norms. Such norms have the ability to structure the prior in order to incorporate some additional assumptions about the sources. We refer to such solvers as mixed-norm estimates (MxNE). In the context of M/EEG, MxNE can promote spatially focal sources with smooth temporal estimates with a two-level ℓ(1)/ℓ(2) mixed-norm, while a three-level mixed-norm can be used to promote spatially non-overlapping sources between different experimental conditions. In order to efficiently solve the optimization problems of MxNE, we introduce fast first-order iterative schemes that for the ℓ(1)/ℓ(2) norm give solutions in a few seconds making such a prior as convenient as the simple MNE. Furthermore, thanks to the convexity of the optimization problem, we can provide optimality conditions that guarantee global convergence. The utility of the methods is demonstrated both with simulations and experimental MEG data.}},

We present OpenMEEG, which solves the electromagnetic forward problem in the quasistatic regime, for head models with piecewise constant conductivity. The core of OpenMEEG consists of the symmetric Boundary Element Method, which is based on an extended Green Representation theorem. OpenMEEG is able to provide lead fields for four different electromagnetic forward problems: Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), and intracranial electric potentials (IPs). OpenMEEG is open source and multiplatform. It can be used from Python and Matlab in conjunction with toolboxes that solve the inverse problem; its integration within FieldTrip is operational since release 2.0.}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Interpreting and controlling bioelectromagnetic phenomena require realistic physiological models and accurate numerical solvers. A semi-realistic model often used in practise is the piecewise constant conductivity model, for which only the interfaces have to be meshed. This simplified model makes it possible to use Boundary Element Methods. Unfortunately, most Boundary Element solutions are confronted with accuracy issues when the conductivity ratio between neighboring tissues is high, as for instance the scalp/skull conductivity ratio in electro-encephalography. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed a new method called the symmetric BEM, which is implemented in the OpenMEEG software. The aim of this paper is to present OpenMEEG, both from the theoretical and the practical point of view, and to compare its performances with other competing software packages.METHODS:We have run a benchmark study in the field of electro- and magneto-encephalography, in order to compare the accuracy of OpenMEEG with other freely distributed forward solvers. We considered spherical models, for which analytical solutions exist, and we designed randomized meshes to assess the variability of the accuracy. Two measures were used to characterize the accuracy. the Relative Difference Measure and the Magnitude ratio. The comparisons were run, either with a constant number of mesh nodes, or a constant number of unknowns across methods. Computing times were also compared.RESULTS:We observed more pronounced differences in accuracy in electroencephalography than in magnetoencephalography. The methods could be classified in three categories: the linear collocation methods, that run very fast but with low accuracy, the linear collocation methods with isolated skull approach for which the accuracy is improved, and OpenMEEG that clearly outperforms the others. As far as speed is concerned, OpenMEEG is on par with the other methods for a constant number of unknowns, and is hence faster for a prescribed accuracy level.CONCLUSIONS:This study clearly shows that OpenMEEG represents the state of the art for forward computations. Moreover, our software development strategies have made it handy to use and to integrate with other packages. The bioelectromagnetic research community should therefore be able to benefit from OpenMEEG with a limited development effort.},

This questions the very sensitivity of MEG to the corresponding neural responses of visual stimuli and the usage of MEG source imaging for innovative retinotopic explorations. In this context, we compare two imaging models of MEG generators in realistic simulations of activations within the visual cortex. Localization and spatial extent of neural activity in the visual cortex were extracted from retinotopic maps obtained in fMRI. We prove that the suggested approaches are robust and succeed in accurately recovering the activation patterns with satisfactory match with fMRI results. These results suggest that fast retinotopic exploration of the visual cortex could be obtained from MEG as a complementary alternative to more standard fMRI approaches. The excellent time resolution of MEG imaging further opens interesting perspectives on the temporal and spectral processes sustained by the human visual system.},
